There are several files in project2 folder first one is a sample dataframe with the name kharid that you could use for your program
There is a file called df which uses pandas and random library and will built a random data frame of shopping list and save it as an excel file
The 2 most important files are project 2 and trendline
- Project 2 is simply a recommendation system using pandas library and lists to save our programs data from excel or csv to lists and using for loops to seek the same products or the diffrence between shopiing lists there is although it could not be used for big dataframes but for low data frames it works ery perfectly and for more dataframes we could use regresion which we will learn during machine learning course
- Trendline is an program that uses yfinance library to download one chart of any cryptucurrency or stocks for loop and prices to find highs and lows in an exact timeline and with connecting highs and lows we plot a trendline.
